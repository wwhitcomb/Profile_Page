        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who loves everything about the web. I've lived in Arizona and Colorado, but currently call Colorado home. I have worked a lot of different joe jobs, so needless to say I am excited to develop a skill that will allow me to do something I enjoy for the foreseeable future. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a Schwan's man, delivered appliances, and have spent too many years in call centers. I am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills, using different platforms like Team Treehouse and Udemy.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>Wordpress</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I want to end up running my own web design business, but understand that I may need to work for a web design firm first to better hone my skills.</p>
