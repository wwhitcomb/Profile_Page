I grew up in Arizona, but have spent the last 15 years in Colorado. I have a wife and 2 kids, and a little pup named Lily.</p>
            <p>I enjoy working with computers, and actually started dabbling with the internet back in 2008, when I got into internet marketing. I tried a variety of different techniques, from SEO to PPC, and was actually able to make a little bit of money, which was nice. But the part I enjoyed the most was designing and making the sites. Back then, I didn't know HTML or CSS, so needless to say when I "made" a site, it was nothing more than a hack job of a current WordPress theme.</p>
            <p>I took a little time off from all of that, but always knew I would get back into it someday. I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP a year or two ago, but it has been more or less at a snails pace. I recently started to challenge myself to get better, and have started dedicating more time to mastering the skills needed.</p>
            <p>That's all for now!
